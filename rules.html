          <h3 id="netrobotics">10 Automation Science Lab Rules</h3>	
		<h4>Being a member of the Automation Science Lab is a privilege only for
		 top-notch students who are actively interested in research.</h4>
		<h4>(Updated Jan 2009)</h4>

          <ul class="projsub">
        <!--<li><span class="title">0. Share.</a></span>-->
	<br><li>
	<b>0. Share.</b><br>
	We actively encourage cross-fertilization.  That is why you
	are here. Please discuss your projects with each other and be generous
	with suggestions/ideas.  At lab meetings, please show interest in
	others projects and participate by asking questions.  If you tune out
	at meetings you are doing everyone, especially yourself, a disservice.
	We are always open to suggestions and input!</li>
        <li><span class="title">

	<li>
	<b>1. Be friendly.</b><br>
	Please be friendly and greet anyone who enters the
	lab.  Get to know others in the lab.  If you don't recognize them, ask
	their name, what they are working on, and introduce yourself.  If they
	are not lab members, please invite them to contact me directly to
	learn more about the lab before they enter.</li>
        <li><span class="title">

	<li>
	<b>2. Be Safe. </b><br>
	Always take good care of your lab key, be sure NOT to
	label it so if it's lost, it can't be used.  ALWAYS deadbolt the lab
	door if you are the last to leave, even if you are just going down the
	hall for a minute to get a drink of water.</li>
        <li><span class="title">

	<li>
	<b>3. Be Alert. </b><br>
	If you notice any problems in the lab: anyone strange or
	leaks or anything suspicious, call University Security immediately:
	642-6760.</li>
        <li><span class="title">

	<li>
	<b>4. Keep it in the family.</b><br>
	Due to space and security constraints, I
	regret that we can't allow lab members to bring in friends who are not
	official lab members, ie, the lab cannot be used at any time for
	class/group meetings.
	</li>
        <li><span class="title">

	<li>
	<b>5. Keep equipment working.</b><br>
	An undergraduate student serves as the lab
	systems adminstrator responsible for ordering supplies, lightbulbs,
	replacing software, keyboards, etc.  Please alert him when something
	is not working, and please alert both of us if you need something that
	is not currently available.
	</li>
        <li><span class="title">

	<li>
	<b>6. Keep the lab looking professional.</b><br>
	I often bring in visitors
	without notice.  Please keep the lab clean and neat by taking a few
	moments before you leave to straighten up the tables and chairs, and
	wipe down the table.  Always carry out garbage so it doesn't leave
	things sticky.  Don't eat anything smelly in the lab.  It is important
	to always leave the main lab conference tables clean and clear, and
	the chairs organized, especially if you are the last to leave.
	</li>
	<li><span class="title">

	<li>
	<b>7. Stash your stuff.</b><br>
	Postdocs, Grad students and active undergrads can
	ask me to assign a drawer in the lab for personal papers/notes etc.</li>
        <li><span class="title">

	<li>
	<b>8. Borrow after asking.</b><br>
	If you want to borrow anything from the lab,
	a book, a tool, an extension cord, etc. please ask me first.  If
	that's not possible, please put a large note on the desk describing
	precisely what you borrowed, the time in, and expected time back.  If
	you don't do this you are stealing, and that's not cool.
	</li>
        <li><span class="title">

	<li>
	<b>9. Attend and Participate in lab meetings.</b><br>
	This is important, it's
	the best way to learn and share ideas.  Due to many time constraints
	we don't set a fixed time for meetings, but try to find times that
	work for as many in the group as possible and give at least a week
	notice.  If you miss a lab meeting we expect you to send an
	explanation via email and update on your progress.  If you miss two
	meetings without an explanation we will restrict your lab privileges
	until we receive an explanation.  Remember that we have limited
	research slots and we rely on undergraduate contributions to group
	research efforts.  If student starts a project and then drops out of
	sight in the middle of the semester, it sets back the project and
	takes away a slot we could give to another student.  If you find
	yourself overwhelmed or distracted, let us know as soon as possible.
	And see Rule 0.

        <b>Inspiring Quote about Research.</b><br>
<i>	Universities are places where facts are made. Research is a collaborative process, so scientists need lab assistants, humanities researchers need library aides and graduate students need all the help they can get. A curious, competent undergraduate can always find work assisting a researcher.

Regardless of the field and the specific project, helping them helps you. The obvious benefits are new skills and invaluable experience. But there is also something powerful in seeing how the right experimental or analytical approach can sort through a mess of observations and opinion to identify real associations between phenomena, like a gene variant and a disease, or a financial tool and the availability of credit. With a window into the world of research, you will find yourself thinking more critically, accepting fewer assertions at face value and perhaps developing an emboldened sense of what you can accomplish.

Most important: research experience shows you how knowledge is produced. There are worse ways to prepare for life in an information age.</i>
