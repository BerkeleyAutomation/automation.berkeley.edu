          <h2>Lab Guide to Reviewing Papers</h2>	
	<br>	<h4>Reviewing papers is a great way to learn about new research and 
		how to write better papers (by putting yourself in the position of a
		reviewer).  The comments below are intended to be helpful, I'm very
		open to other suggestions!</h4>

<br>
Reviewing papers is a great way to learn about new research and 
how to write better papers (by putting yourself in the position of a
reviewer).  The comments below are intended to be helpful, I'm very
open to other suggestions!
<br>
<br>
If you're new to this don't worry.  the best way to learn is by doing.
<br><br>
When you get a paper to review, first check that you have enough time
to complete the review by the deadline given.  try to download it asap
to make sure it prints properly and to insure that the paper isn't
completely beyond your comprehension. Also check that you don't have a
conflict of interest (if you are on the same campus with a co-author
or have written a paper with a co-author in the past 5 years).  If so
notify the assigning person immediately.

<br><br>
If you are helping me with a review, please prepare a plain text
version of your review and email it to me well ahead of the deadline
so I can go over it with you before I finalize.  This is especially
important if you are new to reviewing.

<br><br>
It can take from 2 to 5 hours to do a proper review of a conference
paper, and 5-10 hours or more to do a proper review of a jounal paper.
Usually it takes 3 readings of a paper before you're ready to review
it.

<br><br>
<b><u>1st reading:</u></b> read quickly without taking notes to get the overall
aim and goals of the paper.  don't worry if you don't understand all
the details!

<br><br>
<b><u>2nd reading: </u></b>read carefully and mark with questions, notes.  Use the
internet and library to look up possible related papers that may not
have been cited.

<br><br>
Draft your review (see below).

<br><br>
<b><u>3rd reading: </u></b> read once more carefully to make sure you haven't missed
anything.

<br><br>
---------------

<br><br>
<h3><b>Your Review:</b></h3>
The first part of the review will be a series of bullet points, 
typically choices ranging from Excellent to Poor for:

<br><br>
Originality of concept(s): <br>	
Relevance of applications: <br>	
Technical soundness:	<br>
Thoroughness of results: <br>	
Importance of results: <br>	
Clarity of presentation: <br>

<br><br>
There may also be a request to suggest a Session Title for the paper
or if it should be considered for a Best Paper Award.  Until you've
had extensive experience and can put papers into context of the field,
this is very hard, so please give your best estimates and I'll go over
it after I read your draft.

<br><br>
The key part of your review is the Advice to Authors:

<br><br>
This is a body of text that includes 4 parts:
<ul class="projsub">


<br><br>
<li><b>1)</b> A summary of the paper's main contributions in your own words 
   (be careful not to simply restate the Abstract)</li>
<br>
<li><b>2)</b> Your evaluation of how well the paper reviews Related Work.  For
   this part check Google, CiteSeer, or the library using keywords
   from the paper.  You can suggest that they reference specific
   related papers you find from the last 2-3 years.</li>

<br>
<li><b>3)</b> Your evaluation of strengths and weaknesses of the paper.  Be
   careful to offer constructive suggestions about how they might
   address each of the latter.
</li>

<br>
<li><b>4)</b> suggestions on things to fix, for example figures that are unclear
   or typos (note: for conference papers you don't need to
   proofread in detail, that can take up enormous amounts of time).
   </li>
<br>
<li><b>5)</b> A short summary of your overall evaluation and recommendation, for
   example:  "This paper introduces an interesting new model for
   holding deformable parts and is acceptable for the conference
   but would be improved with more experimental results."
</li></ul>
The body of your Advice to Authors should be at least 100 words
(200-300 is more typical), and longer in a review of a Journal paper.

<br><br>
Under Advice to the Editor/Program Committee, you can usually leave
that blank unless you have something confidential you need to convey,
for example if you find evidence that the paper includes plagiarism
etc.  

<br><br>
Note again that the tone of your review should be constructive and
supportive.  You are an anonymous reviewer, but you should view the
process as though you are reviewing the paper for a friend or
colleague.  If the paper is weak the authors will appreciate and
benefit from your advice and suggestions.

<br><br>
It is much easier to write a positive review than a negative review.
