		<h4>Writing research papers is difficult, but extremely valuable and
		rewarding.  It will really help you structure your ideas and identify
		gaps and new directions.  Below is some advice on structure and below,
		general tips.</h4>

          <ul class="projsub">
        <!--<li><span class="title">0. Share.</a></span>-->
	<br>

<h4>Structure:</h4>
Start by drafting an outline and discuss with your co-authors
   before you dive into writing details:<br>
<br>
<h4>Paper Outline:</h4>
<br>
	<li><b>1. Title and co-authors.</b><br>
	  Think carefully about co-authors.  Usually
	   the most senior co-author is listed last.</li>
        <li><span class="title">

	<li><b>2. Abstract.</b><br>
	Summarize motivation, what's new, primary
   	results/conclusions.  Give the punchline, this is not a movie
   	review!  Summarize your contributions with quantitative results.</li>
        <li><span class="title">

	<li><b>3. Introduction/Motivation.</b><br>
	 Take 3 steps back and explain why your
	   audience should be interested in this paper. Know who your
	   audience is!  Your paper will be very different if you are
	   writing for a general robotics conference vs an automation
	   conference vs an algorithms conference.  Give a concrete example
	   where your problem arises and a few interesting applications.
	   Summarize your contributions and why they are significant.</li>
        <li><span class="title">

	<li><b>4. Related Work.</b><br>
	Demonstrate that you have a scholarly grasp of the
	   published literature on your topic.  organize papers by area and
	   then chronologically within an area and summarize with emphasis
	   on how your approach differs (** this is very important).  One or
	   two sentences for each ref.  More for the ones that are very
	   close to your own work.  Typically 12-20 references for a conf
	   paper, up to 40 for a journal paper.</li>
        <li><span class="title">

	<li><b>5. Problem Statement</b><br>
      notation (use figures)<br>
      assumptions:  (collect and justify all assumptions here)<br>
      parameters:  (list values/ranges you'll use and justify)<br>
     input<br>
      output<br>
      metrics:  (what you will compare and how you will quantify/evaluate the results)</li>
        <li><span class="title">

	<li><b>6. Implementation.</b><br>
	    Details on how your system works, sources of data, etc.
	    Enough info on hardware and software so others can repeat your
		  experiments.  See tips below.</li>
        <li><span class="title">

	<li><b>7. Results and Analysis.</b><br>
	 The most important section.  Think carefully
	    about how to present your results graphically.  Be careful about
	    using colors as they don't print in B&W: use dotted and dashed
	    lines to distinguish curves.  Also, indicate confidence
	    intervals based on std. dev wherever possible.</li>
        <li><span class="title">

	<li><b>8. Discussion and Future Work.</b><br>
	 Summarize again Acknowledge
	    limitations of your paper, suggest open problems for future
	    research.  Don't be afraid to admit the limits: It is much
	    better if you do this than others expose them later!</li>
        <li><span class="title">

	<li><b>9. Acknowledgements.</b><br>
  		Thank those who contributed ideas, references,
                    proofreaders (see below), also thank sponsors
                    with grant numbers.</li>
        <li><span class="title">

	<li><b>10. References.</b><br>
	Be sure to list authors, title, source, and date of
	    every publication</li>
        <li><span class="title"></li>
	
==========================
<h4>General Tips:</h4>
==========================

	<li><b>Define before use.  </b><br>
	Always make sure you define terms/notation before
     you use them.  Since you are so familiar with your topic and notation,
     be on guard for this and your ask your proofreaders to help with this.</li>
        <li><span class="title">

	<li><b>Don't understate.  </b><br>
	Avoid words like "simple", "just", "easy", etc, it's
     nice to be modest but those words make your contributions sound
     weak and what is simple to you is not to your reader.  better
     to describe as "efficient, well-known", take the time in your
     text to explain your decisions and derivations.</li>
        <li><span class="title">

	<li><b>Quantify and be specific whenever possible. </b><br>
	  Avoid vagueness: watch
     out for words like "usually, mostly, often, some, many...".
     Give crisp, refutable hypotheses.</li>
        <li><span class="title">

	<li><b>Provide intuition. </b><br>
  At the start of each section, step back and
     explain your ideas and insights in plain language before you
     give the technical deatails.  use analogies to explain things.
<br>To test your approach, do experiments to compare it with the best
     existing method in terms of output, computation time, etc..  No
     method is perfect.  Explain where yours is better and where it
     is not.</li>
        <li><span class="title">

	<li><b>Experiments are used to <i>evaluate</i>, never to <i>validate</i>.  </b><br>
 You must be objective and do your best to evaluate your method without
     bias.  When reporting results, give enough data to evaluate the
     statistical significance of each experiment.</li>
        <li><span class="title">

	<li><b>Try to construct cases where your method will fail. </b><br>
  These
     counterexamples often lead to insights, or to a proof that your
     method will work in all cases.</li>
        <li><span class="title">

	<li><b>Illustrate whenever possible. </b><br>
Good figures really help clarify a paper.
     spend time on your illustrations and ask friends for input.</li>
        <li><span class="title">

	<li><b>Captions. </b><br>
Ideally, the caption for each figure should be
     self-contained and self-explanatory: describe the variables and
     the intuition behind what is being illustrated.  many readers
     will ONLY look at the figures and captions to get an initial
     impression of the paper and to decide whether or not to commit
     time to reading it.</li>
        <li><span class="title">

	<li><b>Limitations. </b><br>
Clearly acknowledge limitations of your approach, and suggest future
       directions for improvement.</li>
        <li><span class="title">

	<li><b>Proofread. </b><br>
Always use spellcheckers and grammar checkers.</li>
        <li><span class="title">

	<li><b>Schedule. </b><br>
When writing a paper with other co-authors, agree on a schedule as
early as possible working backward from the deadline so that everyone
gets turns taking the edit token and budgets time accordingly so that
there is not a huge rush at the deadline.</li>
        <li><span class="title">

	<li><b>Cultivate good proofreaders!</b><br>
  Cultivate 3 or 4 students/friends you respect who will exchange
  papers with you from proofreading.  You'll learn about writing
  papers from reading their papers, and your papers will really
  benefit from their input.  Make sure you thank them for
  criticizing your paper because they are saving you from being
  criticized by less friendly readers later!<br></li>
